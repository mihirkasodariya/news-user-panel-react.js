            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing
              systems remain confidential, resilient, and available.
              Specifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high
              availability, business continuity, and prompt disaster recovery.
              We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access
              controls.

              replica databases) in case of failure. We take servers out of
              operation as part of regular maintenance, without impacting
              availability.

              While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e.,
              primary data stores loss), we will restore organizational data
              from these backups.

              The Website is hosted on Digital Ocean. Digital Ocean has many
              years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating
              large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the
              Digital Ocean platform and infrastructure. Digital Ocean data
              centers are housed in nondescript facilities, and critical
              facilities have extensive setback and military grade perimeter
              control berms as well as other natural boundary protection.
              Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and
              at building ingress points by professional security staff
              utilizing video surveillance, state-of-the-art intrusion detection
              systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass
              two-factor authentication no fewer than three times to access data
              center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to
              present identification and are signed in and continually escorted
              by authorized staff. Digital Ocean only provides data center
              access and information to employees who have a legitimate business
              need for such privileges. When an employee no longer has a
              business need for these privileges, his or her access is
              immediately revoked, even if they continue to be an employee of
              Digital Ocean. All physical and electronic access to data centers
              by Digital Ocean employees is logged and audited routinely.
              TechShpere Bulletin employees do not have control or access to
              Digital Ocean centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.

              Unusual network patterns or suspicious behaviour are among Weblock
              Infosoft’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and
              management. Digital Ocean intrusion detection and prevention
              systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based
              security to help identify traffic patterns that are similar to
              known attack methods. IDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the
              size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent
              detection controls at data entry points, and developing and
              deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous
              situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the
              system in the first place. We do not provide direct access to
              security event forensics, but we do provide access to our
              engineering and customer support teams during and after any
              unscheduled downtime.
