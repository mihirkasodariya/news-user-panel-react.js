                Contact your bank about payment security policies. Your bank

              <p>
                Your bank might flag any unexpected activity on your account.
                This includes first-time orders and high-value purchases,
                regardless of the amount of funds available or your credit
                limit. Your bank might require your verbal authorisation to
                proceed with a transaction.

              <p>
                Most banks have limits on how much money can be charged or
                accessed in a single day. If you exceed this daily amount, your
                bank might block your account from any further activity
                regardless of available funds in the account. Your bank might
                require you to request a higher purchase limit to complete the
                transaction.

                When you place an order through the Website, we use RazorPay to
                contact your card‚Äôs issuing bank to confirm that your credit
                card has a valid number and has not been reported as lost or
                stolen. This is communicated by means of a full authorisation
                for the amount of the purchase. In case of a failed transaction
                the change and funds would be reserved against your account for
                the authorisation. Some banks might hold these authorisations
                for 7 to 10 business days. If your payment is declined because
                of lack of available funds, contact your bank to confirm whether
                the reserved funds are other authorisations, verify the amount
                of time that they hold authorisations, and request that they
                remove any extra authorisation to free up funds in your account.
